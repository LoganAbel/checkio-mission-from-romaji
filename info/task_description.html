<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Japanese uses a special set of phonetic characters called hiragana, but often times, a standard qwerty keyboard is used when typing in japanese. In this project, you will create a function that can converty from qwerty input into japanese hiragana

</p>

<p>
    All the characters exept the last column are equivilent to the letters above them in the table. However, the last column has some special rules.
    
    <strong>double constanants</strong>
    <p>in the case of double constanants for p, k, g, t, d, s, or z, the first letter is equivalent to the x2 character. for example, kka = x2 ka = っか. in the case of tsu, chi, and shi, only the first letter is repeated</p>

    <strong>small vowels</strong>
    <p>small vowels (~yo, ~yu, ~ya) can be added to any constanant-i characters by removing the i and adding yo, yu, or ya. for example, gyo = gi ~yo = ぎょ. there is an exeption that shi, ji, and chi do not need a y. For example sho = shi ~yo = しょ</p>

    <strong>n's</strong>
    <p>in general, 2 n's are required to make ん, with the exception that only one is needed if the next letter is a constanant besides n. For example, ninja = ni nn ji ~ya = にんじゃ</p>

    <strong>Preconditions:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li><i>only characters typable with a qwerty keyboard will be in the input string. symbols should be left alone, but null should be returned if a letter is unable to be turned into hiragana.</i></li>
    </ul>
